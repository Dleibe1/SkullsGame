# SkullsGame
A touchscreen game I made for my brother

## This repository only includes the files I edited

### This guide assumes you know how to set up a PlatformIO project for an ESP32doit-Devkit-v1

I created the LovyanGFXSetup.hpp file for my ESP32 Devkit-1 in .pio/libdeps/esp32doit-devkit-v1/LovyanGFX/src to get the touchscreen working with my particular setup.  Yours may be different depending on which touchscreen you use.
