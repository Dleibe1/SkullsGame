# Skulls Game
## A touchscreen game I made for my brother
### [Here's a video demonstration on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HvHr4f4hM)

## This repository only includes the files I edited.  
I created this a long time ago before I started using github.  I found these files in my Google drive.  The only library I'm using is the LovyanGFX library.  I created [LovyanGFXSetup.hpp](https://github.com/Dleibe1/SkullsGame/blob/main/LovyanGFXSetup.hpp) to get LovyanGFX to cooperate with my particular set of hardware.  There are plenty of guides on YouTube for setting up LovyanGFX if you want to try this yourself.
