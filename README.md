## A touchscreen game I made for my brother

### This repository only includes the files I edited

### This guide assumes you know to use [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) with an ESP32doit-Devkit-v1

#### Install LovyanGFX version 1.1.9 using PlatformIO's library manager.  The repo can be found here: [https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX](https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX)

#### I created the LovyanGFXSetup.hpp file for my ESP32doit-Devkit-v1 setup in .pio/libdeps/esp32doit-devkit-v1/LovyanGFX/src to get the touchscreen working with my particular setup.  Yours may be different depending on which touchscreen and Micro Controller you use.
